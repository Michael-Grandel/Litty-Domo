# Litty-Domo
Arduino Based 3D Video Game

This video game is a translucent dome where pulses of light spiral upwards to the top. The user has 2 buttons, 
purple and white, and must click the button corresponding to the right pulse color, when the pulse reaches the top.

The pulses are synced the the music and have randomnized as well as custom patterns.

# Materials
The dome was built via 3D printing - SolidWorks. I used Adafruit NeoPixel light strips, and an adruino board. We also attached speaker modules to play the songs.
